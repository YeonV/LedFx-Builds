# [Unofficial LedFx-Nightly-Dev-Builds (BladeMod)](https://github.com/YeonV/LedFx-Builds/releases/latest)

These builds are for ledfx-developers _only_!

Most likely broken for users.

No support or anything!!!

Why?
we don't want to split the users into countless version-depending groups,
but we also need a way to test build-pipelines and other meta stuff (like zeroconf).
